libhei:

A dummy shows an implementation of packing small(or big) packets to
a specific size one(e.g. about mtu size), thus improve net transport performance:
* config.h: related parameters to setup
* hei-packet.c: hei-packet definition and basic operations
* common.c: common routines
* receiver.c: a receiver example, note implement push_buffer function
    to process received packets
* sender.c: a sender example, note implement&hooks push_new_data function
    to push sending data


Basic process on receiver side:
It can do two pass "decoding"(packed packets -> origianl packets):
1. pass1, do best effort
2. pass2, again when re-order or some packets are recovered

It has concept of window and sequence number in one window:
* wid
* seq

wid1 received, then wid2

Also it introduce a tls based logging facility, which helps of
saveing couples of "free()" lines.
