GRUB2 is complex, the code style of grub2-mkconfig seems horrible, and 
it can't build a grub.cfg on a Ubuntu and Fedora co-exists system, where
two kinds of vmlinuz and initrd installed in a seperated boot.

This cleans up grub-mkconfig, and solves my problem.
Note: it should have some regression as some complex logic removed(e.g. 
  for encrypted partition), and only works for Ubuntu and Fedora currently.

Usage:
1. copy to /home/grub
2. Activate it:
 * In Ubuntu:
     mv /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig.moved
     ln -s /home/grub/grub-mkconfig /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig
 * In Fedora:
     mv /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig.moved
     ln -s /home/grub/grub-mkconfig /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig
